A plugin for displaying Guild Wars 2 WvW stat.

== Description ==
A plugin for displaying Guild Wars 2 WvW stat.

Support new skirmish points system.

Core code derived from my crude code here: https://github.com/IronGhost63/gw2-wvw-tools
GitHub Page for this plugin: https://github.com/IronGhost63/wp-gw2-wvw

== Installation ==
Activate plugin then use shortcode [gw2wvw world=]

Example: [gw2wvw world=1018]

Ps. If you didn\'t give world id to the shortcode, It will use 1018 (Northern Shiverpeaks) as default.
