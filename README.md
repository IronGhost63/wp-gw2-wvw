# Guild Wars 2 World vs World

Support new skirmish points system.

Core code derived from my crude code here: https://github.com/IronGhost63/gw2-wvw-tools

## Installation
Activate plugin then use shortcode [gw2wvw world=]

Example: [gw2wvw world=1018]

Ps. If you didn\'t give world id to the shortcode, It will use 1018 (Northern Shiverpeaks) as default.
